Problem:
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Solution:

select (case 
       when (A>=B+C) OR (B>= A+C) OR (C>= A+B) then 'Not A Triangle'
       when A=B and B=C and C=A THEN 'Equilateral'
       when A=B OR A=C OR B=C then 'Isosceles'
       when A!=B AND B!=C AND C!=A THEN  'Scalene'
       end
       )
      from TRIANGLES;
