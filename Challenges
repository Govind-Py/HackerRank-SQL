Problem:

Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, 
then exclude those students from the result.

Solutions:

with tb as(
select hacker_id,
name, 
chal_count, 
count(chal_count) over(partition by chal_count) as chal_count_count 
from ( 
    select c.hacker_id as hacker_id,
    name, 
    count(challenge_id) as chal_count 
    from challenges c inner join hackers h on c.hacker_id=h.hacker_id 
    group by c.hacker_id, name 
    ) as final)

select hacker_id,
name,
chal_count from tb where chal_count_count=1 or chal_count=(select max(chal_count) from tb) 
order by chal_count desc, hacker_id;
