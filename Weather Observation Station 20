Problem:
A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:
with tbl as
(
    select lat_n,
    row_number() over(order by lat_n asc) as lat_asc,
    row_number() over(order by lat_n desc) as lat_desc
    from station
)

select round(avg(lat_n),4) from tbl
where lat_asc in (lat_desc , lat_desc+1, lat_desc-1 )
